## Quick orientation

- Repo type: Next.js 16 app-directory React app with Convex backend + Clerk auth.
- Key folders: `app/` (routes + root layout), `components/` (shared UI), `components/ui/` (shadcn-style UI primitives), `convex/` (Convex config and generated API).

## How the pieces fit (big picture)

- UI is organized as server-first Next app with occasional client components marked `"use client"` (see `components/header.jsx`).
- Authentication: Clerk is used for auth; `app/layout.js` wraps the app in `ClerkProvider`. You'll find Clerk UI in `components/header.jsx` (`SignInButton`, `UserButton`).
- Backend / Realtime: Convex is used as the data backend. The frontend creates a `ConvexReactClient` in `app/ConvexClientProvider.jsx` using `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` and wraps the app in `ConvexProviderWithClerk` so Convex and Clerk interoperate.
- Generated code: `convex/_generated/` contains autogenerated helpers (`api.js`, types). Do NOT edit generated files — regenerate via `npx convex dev`.

## Dev / build commands

- Start development: `npm run dev` (runs `next dev`).
- Build for production: `npm run build` then `npm run start`.
- Lint: `npm run lint` (uses the repo's ESLint config).

Environment notes

- Required env vars used in the codebase:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` — used in `app/ConvexClientProvider.jsx` to construct `ConvexReactClient`.
  - `CLERK_JWT_ISSUER_DOMAIN` (referenced in `convex/auth.config.js`).
- Typical dev setup: create a `.env.local` with the keys above before running `npm run dev`.

Project-specific conventions and patterns

- UI primitives live under `components/ui/` (shadcn-style). Use these instead of ad-hoc markup when possible.
- Root-level shared components (e.g., `components/header.jsx`, `components/theme-provider.jsx`) are plain React components — many are client components (`"use client"`). Keep `use client` at the top of files that use browser-only hooks.
- Aliases: `components.json` config shows aliases like `@/components`, `@/lib` — respect these when importing.
- Generated Convex API: import helpers from `convex/_generated/api.js` (already generated). To add or update Convex functions, edit files in `convex/` (server functions) and run `npx convex dev` to regenerate.

Integration and cross-component notes

- Authentication flow: Clerk wraps the app in `app/layout.js`. For authorizing Convex calls, the `ConvexProviderWithClerk` is used (see `app/ConvexClientProvider.jsx`) — this wiring expects Clerk hooks available on the client.
- Public assets: `components/header.jsx` references `/BeThere_logo.png` in the `public/` folder — keep static assets there.

Common pitfalls for contributors / AI agents

- Do not edit files under `convex/_generated/` — they are regenerated and will be overwritten.
- Many UI files rely on Tailwind + shadcn config; if layout or classes change, check `app/globals.css` and `postcss.config.mjs`.
- When converting a component to client-side, add `"use client"` first and ensure imports (like `next/image`) are client-safe.

Examples to reference when making changes

- Convex wiring: `app/ConvexClientProvider.jsx` — shows client creation and use of `ConvexProviderWithClerk`.
- Auth + layout: `app/layout.js` — shows `ClerkProvider`, `ThemeProvider`, and where `Header` is mounted.
- Auth UI: `components/header.jsx` — shows `SignedIn`/`SignedOut` and Clerk UI components.

If you need more context

- There's no existing agent guidance file — start here and ask for clarification. If you want, I can expand examples (small diffs) for common tasks: adding a Convex query, creating a client component, or registering new UI primitives.

Please review these notes and tell me which areas you'd like expanded (examples: regenerate Convex API steps, env var templates, or a short how-to for adding a new page under `app/`).
